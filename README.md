# Uniqueness Test

## Description

The Uniqueness Test is a simple 100 question test developed using React to determine the uniqueness of an individual on a scale of 0 to 100. The test was inspired by the popular Rice Purity test and designed for the purpose of entertainment. The target audience of this game is Southeast Asian high school students as it was developed to serve as an ice breaker for the workshops I'll be running during SEA Admit Weekend 2023. This test is in no way a legitimate measure of one's individuality.

## Running the Application (2 options)

### Option 1

The Uniqueness Test is hosted on GitHub pages. Follow this [link](https://trungvu08.github.io/uniquenesstest/) to take the test.

### Option 2

You can also play the Uniqueness Test by cloning this repository and running the game locally. To do so, following these steps:

1. have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your device
3. open the command line
4. `git clone https://github.com/trungvu08/uniquenesstest`
5. `cd uniquenesstest`
6. `npm install`
7. `npm start`

## Future Improvements

In the future, I would like to build upon this application by including a data analytics tab so players can compare their scores to the community. GitHub Pages unfortunately only supports static pages, so I'll have to find a site that supports dynamic pages. This would likely be Firebase since it can be used for the database and hosting. When will this feature come around? Not sure. It's not difficult, but I don't have the time for it at the moment.
